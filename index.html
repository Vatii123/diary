<h1>diary: day one</h1>

<h2>coded by autty</h2>

<h3>dear diary, in today i had just finished clean up some of my authax+ 2 project. i finally finished fixing up the targetting msg that are annoying when there's no target it just sent. today, my teacher also let me get some pizza. really delicious ngl. there's soda but i don't eat soda so i just drink some orange juice. the english subject was one of the boring class in the whole semester except for the time that he let me go play boardgames which most of the time it's fun. the home economics homework was somewhat easy but the font Angsana New fucking sucks, i would prefer the font call Lato. it's really good font. that's all my day. thanks you for reading all of this and there would be frequent update here... - vatii123</h3>
